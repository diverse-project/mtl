This project will contains SimpleUML2SimpleRDBMS and SimpleRDBMS2SimpleUML transformation
As the SimpleUML project already exists, we use the metamodel defined there.
As the SimpleRDBMS project doesn't exists, we have our own version of this MM. It a such project is created we should use the MM from there ...
