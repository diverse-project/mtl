User interface for SimpleUML.transformations
To use it you need to create:
- either a *.simpleuml file using simpleUML.editor in this case this is an 
	EMF transformation
- or a *.xml file (for example using Metamodelling module in Objecteering)
	in this case you'll have the choice between MDR or ModFact to transform your model
