Notes on the existing Valooder transorm
---------------------------------------

The existing Valooder transform (VT) is written in Eiffel code and can be seen as a design pattern Visitor.

It actually visits a hierachy of nodes that represents a UML model. This is the internal representation
of Umlaut for a UML model.

VT traverses the hierarchy and proceeds the transformation.


Formalization
-------------

Actually, the transformation is not so well documented. It should be interesting to describe it in a 
more high level description than the Eiffel code itself. 

One attempt could be made to describe (at least the main structure) the VT through UML diagrams (like
sequence diagrams if we keep the imperative way).


Objecteering profile
--------------------

An Objecteering profile could be quickly built in order to add get/set methods to classes of a given 
metamodel; it would be then enough to describe manipulation on instances of metamodels through methods
calls in sequence diagrams.
