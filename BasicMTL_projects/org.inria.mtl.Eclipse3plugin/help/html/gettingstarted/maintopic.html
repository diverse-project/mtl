The Eclipse user interface is divided into windows, perspectives and
views.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Perspectives</b>. A perspective is an arrangement of views in
a window. The active perspective is indicated by the selected button on
the left side of the window. In the figure below, the XML perspective
is active. At the end of the installation, you can open Eclipse. By
default, MTL doesn't appear. You must display the MTL perspective.
Click on the &#8220;open perspective&#8221; option of the menu Window or Click on
the "open perspective" button on the left corner of Eclipse</li>
  <li><b>Views</b> A view is a rectangular section of a window, usually
with its own title bar and close box. The four views in the figure
below, clockwise from upper left are: Navigator view, Editor view,
Tasks view, Outline view and MTL Console View. These are the basic
views for working with MTL Plugin.</li>
</ul>

<h3><b>Navigator View</b></h3>
<p>The Navigator view shows your project and your files, etc.,
collectively called
resources. Except for the project entry at the outermost level, the
Navigator
view is basically a file view that reflects the organization of the
project
folder. When you double-click on a file in the Navigator, it is opened
in an
editor. If the file extension is associated with an internal editor
(see <b>Window</b>
&#8594; <b>Preferences</b> &#8594; <b>Workbench</b> &#8594; <b>File
Associations</b>), it will show up in the Editor view. Otherwise, it
will be
opened in an external editor, i.e., another program. You can select
from among
the possible editors to open a given file by right-clicking on the file
and
choosing <b>Open With</b>. By default, MTL files will be open by the
MTL Editor.</p>
<p>The MTL editor view allows you to modify your documents.</p>
<h3><b><b>Tasks View</b></b></h3>
<p>The Tasks view shows validation errors, which are also indicated by
error or informative icons in
the left margin of the editor view. The error message appears in the
Tasks view
and as hover help (wave the mouse cursor over the icon) in the editor
margin. Double-clicking
on a line in the Tasks view takes you to that line in the Editor view,
opening
the file, if necessary.</p>
<h3><b>Console View</b></h3>
<p>The console view shows validation errors, which are also indicated
by
error or informative icons in
the left margin of the editor view. The error message appears in the
consoel view <br>
</p>
<h3><b><b>Outline View</b></b></h3>
By default, the Outline view tracks the cursor position in the
Editor view and vice versa. The current
element is indicated by selection highlighting in the Outline view.
Conversely,
a selection in the Outline view is indicated by the gray bar in the
left margin of the editor view. The height of the bar indicates the
span of the selection.<br>
