<h1>Create a New Project in an Existing Directory</h1>
<p>As in the previous section, select <b>File</b> &#8594; <b>New</b> &#8594; <b>Project...</b>
Select your project type and click <b>Next</b>. This will bring you to
the project name and location page.</p>
<p>Enter a project name as in the previous section, but instead of
clicking <b>Finish</b> uncheck the <b>Use default</b> checkbox.</p>
<table cellpadding="3" align="center" border="0">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="newProjdir.JPG" title="Creating a New Project"
 alt="" style="width: 441px; height: 412px;"> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th align="center">Figure 1: Use Existing Directory</th>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Type in the absolute path to an existing directory, or use the <b>Browse...</b>
button to locate the directory in the file system. When you have
identified the directory, click <b>Finish</b>.</p>
<table cellpadding="3" align="center" border="0">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="newprojpres.JPG" title="" alt=""
 style="width: 279px; height: 433px;"> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

    </tr>
  </tbody>

<p>Our example <code><span
 style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">MonProj</span></code>
directory contained some subdirectory named <code>src, build, models
like predefine in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Preferences/New
Project</span></code>. As you can see, those subdirectories have become
part of our new project.</p>
<p>Note that the project contains a file named <code>.project</code>,
just as in the preceding section. This file wasn't in the existing
directory, but if you look at the disk, you will see that it is now; it
was written there by Eclipse as part creating the project.</p>
<p>There is no way to avoid having the <code>.project</code> file
written. It doesn't take up much space and shouldn't be a real concern,
but if you absolutely cannot add a file to a directory you want to use,
your other choice is to import the directory, which copies the files
into your project directory. This is discussed in a separate section.</p>
<p>There is currently away for an MTL project to refer to a directory
outside the project directory. However, a Java project can have a
number of source directories that do not have to be in the
project.&nbsp; You do it by right-clicking on the project in the
Navigator or Package Explorer view and selecting <b>Properties</b> &#8594; <b>MTL
Build Path</b> &#8594; <b>Source</b> &#8594; <b>Add Existing Folders...</b> You
can do the same thing with the Java project which will be generated by
the MTL project See the Java documentation for more details.</p>
