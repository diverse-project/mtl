<h1>Create a New Project in the Workspace</h1>
<p>To create a new project, select <b>File</b> &#8594; <b>New</b> &#8594; <b>Project...</b>
This will produce the dialog shown below.</p>
<table cellpadding="3" align="center" border="0">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="newp.JPG" title="" alt=""
 style="width: 500px; height: 500px;"><br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th align="center">Figure 1: Create Project Dialog</th>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>In the dialog, select the kind of project you wish to create, e.g., <code>Java</code>,
<code>Simple</code>, etc. on the left-hand side. On the right-hand side
select the specific project type.</p>
<p>In the example dialog, we show how to create an MTL project.</p>
<p>When you have selected your project type, press <b>Next</b> to
provide a project name.</p>
<table cellpadding="3" align="center" border="0">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="newp2.JPG" title="" alt=""
 style="width: 500px; height: 500px;"><br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th align="center">Figure 2: Project Name and Location</th>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Fill in your project name and click <b>Finish</b> to create your
project in the default location. (The default location, as you can see
in the dialog, is a directory with your project name inside the active
workspace directory.)</p>
<p>You newly created project will appear in the Navigator view, as
shown below.</p>
<table cellpadding="3" align="center" border="0">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="newprojpres.JPG" title="" alt=""
 style="width: 279px; height: 433px;"><br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th align="center">Figure 3: New Project in Navigator View</th>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Note the <code>.project</code> and .classpath&nbsp; files. Those
files are created by Eclipse to mark the directory as containing an
Eclipse Java project. Names beginning with a period are used by Eclipse
plugins to mark files that are not explicitly created by the user. It
is a good idea not to use such names for your own files, as there is a
potential for conflict with some future plugin.</p>
<p>Since we created an MTL project, by default it shows up in the MTL
perspective in the Navigator view. If you create a Java project, it
will appear in the Java perspective in the view you last had open in
that perspective.</p>
<p>You can editMTL files in any project type. The MTL and Java
perspectives are pre-configured to show the MTL wizards in the toolbar,
but you have to manually configure non-MTL perspectives to get the <b>New</b>
MTL wizards into the menus. See <b>Window</b> &#8594; <b>Customize
Perspective...</b> &#8594; <b>File &gt; New</b>. </p>
