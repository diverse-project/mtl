DO NOT CHANGE DIRECTLY THESE JAVA FILES
These java files are generated from an Obejcteering Model
located in /udd/triskell/dev/MT_shared/BasicMtlTLLJava/objecteeringRepository
(create your own obecjteering base (*.ofp) connected via the multiuser module to this dir)

if you want to regenerate be sure that you have synchronized this srcOfp directory 
so it has the latest version of the files.

also be sure to have the correct generation configuration (see MTDevelopperGuide.doc for further details)
abstract points from the configuration details:
- accessors are generated public except for private attributes
- do not generate markers
- description notes processes as javadoc
