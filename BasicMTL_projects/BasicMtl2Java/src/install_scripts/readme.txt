This is the easiest way to install a new development environment for MTL. 
It will download and install a brand new version of eclipse + some plugins.
Once installed, you can remove the temp directory (unless you want to run it later, then it may reduce installation time by not downloading again the files from the net)



Command:
	Simply run install.bat or install_irisa_specific.bat



2 versions:
	general version that works for every body by downloading direclty from the web. (some plugins aren't downloaded in that case: omondo)
