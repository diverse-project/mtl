This directory provides different samples for build.properties files that are used by the build scripts.
They corresponds to various version of eclipse.

The user must choose one, rename and copy it to the root of this project. Eventually, he may have to 
adapt it to his own configuration.

Important note!
This is sample only, please verify version number of each component for your actual configuration.
However you may be able to copy the file corresponding to your eclipse version in  ${eclipse}\workspace\BasicMtl2Java
and rename it build.properties
